  known_hosts: Fail when parsing unknown keys in known_hosts file.
  
  libssh2_knownhost_readfile() silently ignored problems when reading keys
  in unsupported formats from the known hosts file. When the file is
  written again from the internal structures of libssh2 it gets truntcated
  to the point where the first unknown key was located.

  compression: add support for zlib@openssh.com
  
  Add a "use_in_auth" flag to the LIBSSH2_COMP_METHOD struct and a
  separate "zlib@openssh.com" method, along with checking session->state
  for LIBSSH2_STATE_AUTHENTICATED. Appears to work on the OpenSSH servers
  I've tried against, and it should work as before with normal zlib
  compression.

  session_free: wrong variable used for keeping state
  
  If libssh2_session_free is called without the channel being freed
  previously by libssh2_channel_free a memory leak could occur.
  
  A mismatch of states variables in session_free() prevent the call to
  libssh2_channel_free function. session->state member is used instead of
  session->free_state.
  
  It causes a leak of around 600 bytes on every connection on my systems
  (Linux, x64 and PPC).
  
  (Debugging done under contract for Accedian Networks)

Daniel Stenberg (19 Jun 2012)
- libssh2_userauth_publickey_fromfile_ex.3: mention publickey == NULL

- comp_method_zlib_decomp: handle Z_BUF_ERROR when inflating
  
  When using libssh2 to perform an SFTP file transfer from the "JSCAPE MFT
  Server" (http://www.jscape.com) the transfer failed. The default JSCAPE
  configuration is to enforce zlib compression on SSH2 sessions so the
  session was compressed. The relevant part of the debug trace contained:
  
   [libssh2] 1.052750 Transport: unhandled zlib error -5
   [libssh2] 1.052750 Failure Event: -29 - decompression failure
  
  The trace comes from comp_method_zlib_decomp() in comp.c. The "unhandled
  zlib error -5" is the status returned from the zlib function
  inflate(). The -5 status corresponds to "Z_BUF_ERROR".
  
  The inflate() function takes a pointer to a z_stream structure and
  "inflates" (decompresses) as much as it can. The relevant fields of the
  z_stream structure are:
  
    next_in - pointer to the input buffer containing compressed data
    avail_in - the number of bytes available at next_in
    next_out - pointer to the output buffer to be filled with uncompressed
               data
    avail_out - how much space available at next_out
  
  To decompress data you set up a z_stream struct with the relevant fields
  filled in and pass it to inflate(). On return the fields will have been
  updated so next_in and avail_in show how much compressed data is yet to
  be processed and next_out and avail_out show how much space is left in
  the output buffer.
  
  If the supplied output buffer is too small then on return there will be
  compressed data yet to be processed (avail_in != 0) and inflate() will
  return Z_OK. In this case the output buffer must be grown, avail_out
  updated and inflate() called again.
  
  If the supplied output buffer was big enough then on return the
  compressed data will have been exhausted (avail_in == 0) and inflate()
  will return Z_OK, so the data has all been uncompressed.
  
  There is a corner case where inflate() makes no progress. That is, there
  may be unprocessed compressed data and space available in the output
  buffer and yet the function does nothing. In this case inflate() will
  return Z_BUF_ERROR. From the zlib documentation and the source code it
  is not clear under what circumstances this happens. It could be that it
  needs to write multiple bytes (all in one go) from its internal state to
  the output buffer before processing the next chunk of input but but
  can't because there is not enough space (though my guesses as to the
  cause are not really relevant). Recovery from Z_BUF_ERROR is pretty
  simple - just grow the output buffer, update avail_out and call
  inflate() again.
  
  The comp_method_zlib_decomp() function does not handle the case when
  inflate() returns Z_BUF_ERROR. It treats it as a non-recoverable error
  and basically aborts the session.

Alexander Lamaison (15 May 2012)
- win32/libssh2_config.h: Remove hardcoded #define LIBSSH2_HAVE_ZLIB.
  
  Rationale: Everything else in this file states a fact about the win32
  platform that is unconditional for that platform.  There is nothing
  unconditional about the presence of zlib.  It is neither included with
  Windows nor with the platform SDK.  Therefore, this is not an appropriate
  place to assert its presence.  Especially as, once asserted, it cannot be
  overridden using a compiler flag.
  
  In contrast, if it is omitted, then it can easily be reasserted by adding
  a compiler flag defining LIBSSH2_HAVE_ZLIB.

- _libssh2_packet_add: SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST default to want_reply

  FALSE. Now changed.

  Fixes #224

Alexander Lamaison (13 May 2012)
- Prevent sftp_packet_read accessing freed memory.
  
  sftp_packet_add takes ownership of the packet passed to it and (now that we
  handle zombies) might free the packet.  sftp_packet_read uses the packet type
  byte as its return code but by this point sftp_packet_add might have freed
  it.  This change fixes the problem by caching the packet type before calling
  sftp_packet_add.
  
  I don't understand why sftp_packet_read uses the packet type as its return
  code.  A future change might get rid of this entirely.

Daniel Stenberg (12 May 2012)
- sftp_packet_flush: flush zombies too
  
  As this function is called when the SFTP session is closed, it needs to
  also kill all zombies left in the SFTP session to avoid leaking memory
  just in case some zombie would still be in there.

- sftp_packetlist_flush: zombies must not have responses already
  
  When flushing the packetlist, we must only add the request as a zombie
  if no response has already been received. Otherwise we could wrongly
  make it a zombie even though the response was already received and then
  we'd get a zombie stuck there "forever"...

- sftp_read: on EOF remove packet before flush
  
  Since the sftp_packetlist_flush() function will move all the existing
  FXP_READ requests in this handle to the zombie list we must first remove
  this just received packet as it is clearly not a zombie.

- sftp_packet_require: sftp_packet_read() returning 0 is not an error
  
  Exactly as the comment in the code said, checking the return code from
  sftp_packet_read() with <= was wrong and it should be < 0. With the new
  filtering on incoming packets that are "zombies" we can now see this
  getting zero returned.

- sftp_packetlist_flush: only make it zombie if it was sent
  
  The list of outgoing packets may also contain packets that never were
  sent off and we better not make them zombies too.

- [Alexander Lamaison brought this change]

  Mark outstanding read requests after EOF as zombies.
  
  In order to be fast, sftp_read sends many read requests at once.  With a small
  file, this can mean that when EOF is received back, many of these requests are
  still outstanding.  Responses arriving after we close the file and abandon the
  file handle are queued in the SFTP packet queue and never collected.  This
  causes transfer speed to drop as a progressively longer queue must be searched
  for every packet.
  
  This change introduces a zombie request-ID list in the SFTP session that is
  used to recognise these outstanding requests and prevent them being added to
  the queue.

  Update win32/GNUmakefile to use OpenSSL 1.0.1a
  
  libcrypto on win32 now depends on gdi32.dll, so move the OpenSSL LDLIBS
  block to before the compiler definitions, so that libcrypto gets added
  first, and then add -lgdi32 into the following common LDLIBS for gcc.

Guenter Knauf (23 Apr 2012)
- Changed 'Requires' to 'Requires.private'.
  
  Only static builds need to link against the crypto libs.

- Fixed 'Requires:' names.
  
  The 'Requires:' line lists the names of the .pc files.

- Added 'Requires:' line to libssh2.pc.
  
  This is necessary so that other libs which lookup libssh2 info
  via pkg-config can add the right crypto lib dependencies.

- Updated dependency lib versions.

Peter Stuge (18 Apr 2012)
- configure.ac: Add option to disable build of the example applications
  
  Examples are built by default. Any of the following options on the
  configure command line will skip building them:
  
    --disable-examples-build
    --enable-examples-build=no
    --enable-examples-build=false

- userauth.c: fread() from public key file to correctly detect any errors
  
  If the filename parameter for file_read_publickey() was the name of a
  directory instead of a file then libssh2 would spin trying to fgetc()
  from the FILE * for the opened directory when trying to determine the
  length of the encoded public key, since fgetc() can't report errors.
  
  Use fread() instead to correctly detect this error condition along
  with many others.
  
  This fixes the problem reported in

- version: bump to 1.4.2
  
  We're on the 1.4.2 track now (at least)

Version 1.4.1 (4 Apr 2012)

Daniel Stenberg (4 Apr 2012)
- RELEASE-NOTES: updated for 1.4.1 release

- always do "forced" window updates
  
  When calling _libssh2_channel_receive_window_adjust() internally, we now
  always use the 'force' option to prevent libssh2 to avoid sending the
  update if the update isn't big enough.
  
  It isn't fully analyzed but we have seen corner cases which made a
  necessary window update not get send due to this and then the other side
  doesn't send data our side then sits waiting for forever.

- channel_read: force window adjusts!
  
  if there's not enough room to receive the data that's being requested,
  the window adjustment needs to be sent to the remote and thus the force
  option has to be used. _libssh2_channel_receive_window_adjust() would
  otherwise "queue" small window adjustments for a later packet but that
  is really terribly for the small buffer read that for example is the
  final little piece of a very large file as then there is no logical next
  packet!

- [Matthew Booth brought this change]

  transport_send: Finish in-progress key exchange before sending data
  
  _libssh2_channel_write() first reads outstanding packets before writing
  new data. If it reads a key exchange request, it will immediately start
  key re-exchange, which will require sending a response. If the output
  socket is full, this will result in a return from
  _libssh2_transport_read() of LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN. In order not to block
  a write because there is no data to read, this error is explicitly
  ignored and the code continues marshalling a packet for sending. When it
  is sent, the remote end immediately drops the connection because it was
  expecting a continuation of the key exchange, but got a data packet.
  
  This change adds the same check for key exchange to
  _libssh2_transport_send() that is in _libssh2_transport_read(). This
  ensures that key exchange is completed before any data packet is sent.

- channel_write: acknowledge transport errors
  
  When draining data off the socket with _libssh2_transport_read() (which
  in turn has to be done so that we can be sure to have read any possible
  window-increasing packets), this code previously ignored errors which
  could lead to nasty loops. Now all error codes except EAGAIN will cause
  the error to be returned at once.

- sftp_packet_read: follow-up fix for EAGAIN/window adjust
  
  The commit in 7194a9bd7ba45 wasn't complete. This change makes sure
  variables are initialized properly before used in the EAGAIN and window
  adjust cases.

- sftp_packet_add: use named error code instead of number

- sftp_packet_add: verify the packet before accepting it
  
  In order to bail out as quickly as possible when things are wrong and
  out of sync, make sure the SFTP message is one we understand.

- SFTP: preserve the original error code more
  
  Lots of places in the code translated the original error into the more
  generic LIBSSH2_ERROR_SOCKET_TIMEOUT but this turns out to distort the
  original error reason a lot and makes tracking down the real origin of a
  problem really hard. This change makes the original error code be
  preserved to a larger extent when return up to the parent function.

- sftp_packet_read: adjust window size as necessary
  
  Commit 03ca9020756 tried to simplify the window sizing logic but broke
  SFTP readdir as there was no window sizing code left there so large
  directory listings no longer worked.
  
  This change introduces window sizing logic to the sftp_packet_read()
  function so that it now tells the remote about the local size having a
  window size that suffice when it is about to ask for directory data.

- Define and use LIBSSH2_INVALID_SOCKET instead of INVALID_SOCKET
  
  INVALID_SOCKET is a special value in Windows representing a

  Let's have our own identifier instead.

  Simplified sftp_read.
  
  Removed the total_read variable that originally must have tracked how
  much data had been written to the buffer.  With non-blocking reads, we
  must return straight away once we have read data into the buffer so this
  variable served not purpose.
  
  I think it was still hanging around in case the initial processing of
  'leftover' data meant we wrote to the buffer but this case, like the
  others, must return immediately.  Now that it does, the last remaining
  need for the variable is gone.

- LIBSSH2_SFTP_PACKET_MAXLEN: increase to 80000
  
  Some SFTP servers send SFTP packets larger than 40000. Since the limit
  is only present to avoid insane sizes anyway, we can easily bump it.
  
  The define was formerly in the public header libssh2_sftp.h but served
  no external purpose and was moved into the source dir.

  knownhost_check(): Don't dereference ext if NULL is passed
  
  Documentation for libssh2_knownhost_checkp() and related functions
  states that the last argument is filled with data if non-NULL.
  
  "knownhost if set to non-NULL, it must be a pointer to a 'struct
  libssh2_knownhost' pointer that gets filled in to point to info about a
  known host that matches or partially matches."
  
  In this function ext is dereferenced even if set to NULL, causing
  segfault in applications not needing the extra data.

  knownhost_add: Avoid dereferencing uninitialized memory on error path.
  
  In function knownhost_add, memory is alocated for a new entry. If normal
  alocation is used, memory is not initialized to 0 right after, but a
  check is done to verify if correct key type is passed. This test is done
  BEFORE setting the memory to null, and on the error path function
  free_host() is called, that tries to dereference unititialized memory,
  resulting into a glibc abort().

  Correct Windows include file name case, simplifying cross-compilation
  
  When cross compiling to Windows, libssh2.h include Windows header files
  with upper case filenames : BaseTsd.h and WinSock2.h.
  
  These files have lowercase names with mingw-w64 (iirc, it's the same with
  mingw). And as on Windows, being lowercase or uppercase does not matter.

- window_size: explicit adjustments only
  
  Removed the automatic window_size adjustments from

  sure to enlarge the window sizes properly themselves.
  
  libssh2_channel_read_ex() - the public function, now grows the window
  size according to the requested buffer size. Applications can still opt
  to grow the window more on demand. Larger windows tend to give higher
  performance.
  
  sftp_read() now uses the read-ahead logic to figure out a window_size.

  libssh2_sftp_seek64: flush packetlist and buffered data
  
  When seeking to a new position, flush the packetlist and buffered data
  to prevent already received or pending data to wrongly get used when
  sftp-reading from the new offset within the file.

- sftp_read: advance offset correctly for buffered copies
  
  In the case where a read packet has been received from the server, but
  the entire contents couldn't be copied to the user-buffer, the data is
  instead buffered and copied to the user's buffer in the next invocation
  of sftp_read(). When that "extra" copy is made, the 'offset' pointer was
  not advanced accordingly.
  
  The biggest impact of this flaw was that the 'already' variable at the
  top of the function that figures out how much data "ahead" that has
  already been asked for would slowly go more and more out of sync, which
  could lead to the file not being read all the way to the end.
  
  This problem was most noticable in cases where the application would
  only try to read the exact file size amount, like curl does. In the
  examples libssh2 provides the sftp read function is most often called
  with a fixed size large buffer and then the bug would not appear as
  easily.
  
  This bug was introduced in the SFTP rewrite in 1.2.8.

- uint32: more longs converted to proper types
  
  I also moved the MAC struct over to the mac.h header file and made sure
  that the users of that struct include that file.

- SFTP: more types to uint32_t
  
  The 'num_names' field in the SSH_FXP_NAME response is an unsigned 32bit
  value so we make sure to treat it like that.

- SFTP: request_ids are uint32_t
  
  I went over the code and made sure we use uint32_t all over for the
  request_id data. It is an unsigned 32bit value on the wire.

- SFTP: store request_id separately in packets
  
  By using a new separate struct for incoming SFTP packets and not sharing
  the generic packet struct, we can get rid of an unused field and add a
  new one dedicated for holding the request_id for the incoming
  package. As sftp_packet_ask() is called fairly often, a "mere" integer
  comparison is MUCH faster than the previous memcmp() of (typically) 5
  bytes.

- libssh2_sftp_open_ex: man page extended and cleaned up
  
  I added the missing documentation for the 'flags' argument.

- SFTP: unify the READ/WRITE chunk structs

- SFTP: fix memory leaks
  
  Make sure that we cleanup remainders when the handle is closed and when
  the subsystem is shutdown.
  
  Existing flaw: if a single handle sends packets that haven't been
  replied to yet at the time when the handle is closed, those packets will
  arrive later and end up in the generic packet brigade queue and they
  will remain in there until flushed. They will use unnecessary memory,
  make things slower and they will ruin the SFTP handling if the
  request_id counter ever wraps (highly unlikely to every happen).

- sftp_close_handle: packet list is generic
  
  Fix comment, simplify the loop logic

- sftp_read: pipeline reads
  
  The SFTP read function now does transfers the same way the SFTP write
  function was made to recently: it creates a list of many outgoing
  FXP_READ packets that each asks for a small data chunk. The code then
  tries to keep sending read request while collecting the acks for the
  previous requests and returns the received data.

- sftp_write: removed unused variable

- _libssh2_channel_close: don't call transport read if disconnected
  
  The loop that waits for remote.close to get set may end up looping
  forever since session->socket_state gets set to
  LIBSSH2_SOCKET_DISCONNECTED by the packet_add() function called from the
  transport_read() function and after having been set to
  LIBSSH2_SOCKET_DISCONNECTED, the transport_read() function will only
  return 0.

  Split off libssh2_sftp_seek64 from the libssh2_sftp_seek man page, and
  mentioned that we consider the latter deprecated. Also added a mention
  about the dangers of doing seek during writing or reading.

- sftp_seek: fix
  
  The new SFTP write code caused a regression as the seek function no
  longer worked as it didn't set the write position properly.
  
  It should be noted that seeking is STRONGLY PROHIBITED during upload, as
  the upload magic uses two different offset positions and the multiple
  outstanding packets etc make them sensitive to change in the midst of
  operations.
  
  This functionality was just verified with the new example code
  sftp_append. This bug was filed as bug #202:
  
  Bug: http://trac.libssh2.org/ticket/202

- sftp_append: new example doing SFTP append

- MAX_SFTP_OUTGOING_SIZE: 30000
  
  I ran SFTP upload tests against localhost. It showed that to make the
  app reach really good speeds, I needed to do a little code tweak and
  change MAX_SFTP_OUTGOING_SIZE from 4000 to 30000. The tests I did before
  with the high latency tests didn't show any real difference whatever I
  had that size set to.
  
  This number is the size in bytes that libssh2 cuts off the large input
  buffer and sends off as an individual sftp packet.

- sftp_write_sliding.c: new example
  
  This is an example that is very similar to sftp_write_nonblock.c, with
  the exception that this uses
  
  1 - a larger upload buffer
  
  2 - a sliding buffer mechnism to allow the app to keep sending lots of
  data to libssh2 without having to first drain the buffer.
  
  These are two key issues to make libssh2 SFTP uploads really perform
  well at this point in time.

- cpp: s/#elsif/#elif
  
  This looks like a typo as #elsif is not really C...

- _libssh2_channel_write: revert channel_write() use
  
  The attempts made to have _libssh2_channel_write() accept larger pieces
  of data and split up the data by itself into 32700 byte chunks and pass
  them on to channel_write() in a loop as a way to do faster operations on
  larger data blocks was a failed attempt.
  
  The reason why it is difficult:
  
  The API only allows EAGAIN or a length to be returned. When looping over
  multiple blocks to get sent, one block can get sent and the next might
  not. And yet: when transport_send() has returned EAGAIN we must not call
  it again with new data until it has returned OK on the existing data it
  is still working on. This makes it a mess and we do get a much easier
  job by simply returning the bytes or EAGAIN at once, as in the EAGAIN
  case we can assume that we will be called with the same arguments again
  and transport_send() will be happy.
  
  Unfortunately, I think we take a small performance hit by not being able
  to do this.

- ssh2_echo: new example
  
  This is a new example snippet. The code is largely based on ssh2_exec,
  and is written by Tommy Lindgren. I edited it into C90 compliance and to
  conform to libssh2 indent style and some more.

- send_existing: return after send_existing
  
  When a piece of data is sent from the send_existing() function we must
  make the parent function return afterwards. Otherwise we risk that the
  parent function tries to send more data and ends up getting an EGAIN for
  that more data and since it can only return one return code it doesn't
  return info for the successfully sent data.
  
  As this change is a regression I now added a larger comment explaining
  why it has to work like this.

- _libssh2_channel_write: count resent data as written
  
  In the logic that resends data that was kept for that purpose due to a
  previous EAGAIN, the data was not counted as sent causing badness.

Peter Stuge (13 Nov 2010)
- Use fprintf(stderr, ) instead of write(2, ) for debugging

- session/transport: Correctly handle when _libssh2_send() returns -EAGAIN

- src/agent.c: Simplify _libssh2_send() error checking ever so slightly

Daniel Stenberg (12 Nov 2010)
- send/recv: use _libssh2_recv and _libssh2_send now
  
  Starting now, we unconditionally use the internal replacement functions
  for send() and recv() - creatively named _libssh2_recv() and
  _libssh2_send().
  
  On errors, these functions return the negative 'errno' value instead of
  the traditional -1. This design allows systems that have no "natural"
  errno support to not have to invent it. It also means that no code
  outside of these two transfer functions should use the errno variable.

- channel_write: move some logic to _libssh2_channel_write
  
  Some checks are better done in _libssh2_channel_write just once per
  write instead of in channel_write() since the looping will call the
  latter function multiple times per _libssh2_channel_write() invoke.

- sftp_write: handle "left over" acked data
  
  The SFTP handle struct now buffers number of acked bytes that haven't
  yet been returned. The way this is used is as following:
  
  1. sftp_write() gets called with a buffer of let say size 32000. We
  split 32000 into 8 smaller packets and send them off one by one. One of
  them gets acked before the function returns so 4000 is returned.
  
  2. sftp_write() gets called again a short while after the previous one,
  now with a much smaller size passed in to the function. Lets say 8000.
  In the mean-time, all of the remaining packets from the previous call
  have been acked (7*4000 = 28000). This function then returns 8000 as all
  data passed in are already sent and it can't return any more than what
  it got passed in. But we have 28000 bytes acked. We now store the
  remaining 20000 in the handle->u.file.acked struct field to add up in
  the next call.
  
  3. sftp_write() gets called again, and now there's a backlogged 20000
  bytes to return as fine and that will get skipped from the beginning
  of the buffer that is passed in.

- sftp_write: polished and simplified
  
  Removed unnecessary struct fields and state changes within the function.
  
  Made the loop that checks for ACKs only check chunks that were fully
  sent.

- SCP: on failure, show the numerical error reason
  
  By calling libssh2_session_last_errno()

- SFTP: provide the numerical error reason on failure

- SCP: clean up failure treatment
  
  When SCP send or recv fails, it gets a special message from the server
  with a warning or error message included. We have no current API to
  expose that message but the foundation is there. Removed unnecessary use
  of session struct fields.

- sftp_write: enlarge buffer to perform better

- packets: code cleanup
  
  I added size checks in several places. I fixed the code flow to be easier
  to read in some places.
  
  I removed unnecessary zeroing of structs. I removed unused struct fields.

- LIBSSH2_CALLBACK_MACERROR: clarify return code use

- _libssh2_userauth_publickey: avoid shadowing

- packet: avoid shadowing global symbols

- sftp_readdir: avoid shadowing

- shadowing: don't shadow the global compress

- _libssh2_packet_add: turn ifs into a single switch

- _libssh2_packet_add: check SSH_MSG_GLOBAL_REQUEST packet

- _libssh2_packet_add: SSH_MSG_DEBUG length checks
  
  Verify lengths before using them. Read always_display from the correct
  index. Don't copy stuff around just to provide zero-termination of the
  strings.

- _libssh2_packet_add: SSH_MSG_IGNORE skip memmove
  
  There's no promise of a zero termination of the data in the callback so
  no longer perform ugly operation in order to provide it.

- _libssh2_packet_add: SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT length checks
  
  Verify lengths before trying to read data.

- indent: break lines at 80 columns

- SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN_FAILURE: used defined values
  
  We don't like magic numbers in the code. Now the acceptable failure
  codes sent in the SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN_FAILURE message are added as
  defined values in the private header file.

- sftp_write: don't return EAGAIN if no EAGAIN was received
  
  This function now only returns EAGAIN if a lower layer actually returned
  EAGAIN to it. If nothing was acked and no EAGAIN was received, it will
  now instead return 0.

- _libssh2_wait_socket: detect nothing-to-wait-for
  
  If _libssh2_wait_socket() gets called but there's no direction set to
  wait for, this causes a "hang". This code now detects this situation,
  set a 1 second timeout instead and outputs a debug output about it.

- decomp: remove the free_dest argument
  
  Since the decompress function ALWAYS returns allocated memory we get a
  lot simpler code by removing the ability to return data unallocated.

- decomp: cleaned off old compression stuff
  
  I cleared off legacy code from when the compression and decompression
  functions were a single unified function. Makes the code easier to read
  too.

  zlib: Add debug tracing of zlib errors

- sftp_packet_read: handle partial reads of the length field
  
  SFTP packets come as [32 bit length][payload] and the code didn't
  previously handle that the initial 32 bit field was read only partially
  when it was read.

  kex_agree_hostkey: fix NULL pointer derefence
  
  While setting up the session, ssh tries to determine the type of
  encryption method it can use for the session. This requires looking at
  the keys offered by the remote host and comparing these with the methods
  supported by libssh2 (rsa & dss). To do this there is an iteration over
  the array containing the methods supported by libssh2.
  
  If there is no agreement on the type of encryption we come to the 3rd
  entry of the hostkeyp array. Here hostkeyp is valid but *hostkep is
  NULL. Thus when we dereference that in (*hostkeyp)->name there is a
  crash

- _libssh2_transport_send: remove dead assignment
  
  'data' isn't accessed beyond this point so there's no need to assign it.

- scp_recv: remove dead assignment
  
  Instead of assigning a variable we won't read, we now use the more
  explicit (void) prefix.

- sftp_write: removed superfluous assignment

- bugfix: avoid use of uninitialized value

- sftp_packet_require: propagate error codes better
  
  There were some chances that they would cause -1 to get returned by
  public functions and as we're hunting down all such occurances and since
  the underlying functions do return valuable information the code now
  passes back proper return codes better.

- [Alfred Gebert brought this change]

  fix memory leaks (two times cipher_data) for each sftp session

- libssh2_userauth_authenticated: make it work as documented
  
  The man page clearly says it returns 1 for "already authenticated" but
  the code said non-zero. I changed the code to use 1 now, as that is also
  non-zero but it gets the benefit that it now matches the documentation.
  
  Using 1 instead of non-zero is better for two reasons:
  
  1. We have the opportunity to introduce other return codes in the future for
     things like error and what not.
  2. We don't expose the internal bitmask variable value.

- userauth_keyboard_interactive: fix indent

- [Alfred Gebert brought this change]

  fix memory leak in userauth_keyboard_interactive()
  
  First I wanted to free the memory in session_free() but then
  I had still memory leaks because in my test case the function
  userauth_keyboard_interactive() is called twice. It is called
  twice perhaps because the server has this authentication
  methods available: publickey,gssapi-with-mic,keyboard-interactive
  The keyboard-interactive method is successful.

  I found an undocumented public function and we can't have it like
  that. The description here is incomplete, but should serve as a template

- libssh2_sftp_write.3: added blurb about the "write ahead"
  
  Documented the new SFTP write concept

- sftp_close_handle: free any trailing write chunks

- _libssh2_channel_write: fix warnings

- SFTP: bufgix, move more sftp stuff to sftp.h
  
  The sftp_write function shouldn't assume that the buffer pointer will be
  the same in subsequent calls, even if it assumes that the data already
  passed in before haven't changed.
  
  The sftp structs are now moved to sftp.h (which I forgot to add before)

- SFTP: use multiple outgoing packets when writing
  
  sftp_write was rewritten to split up outgoing data into multiple packets
  and deal with the acks in a more asynchronous manner. This is meant to
  help overcome latency and round-trip problems with the SFTP protocol.

- TODO: implemented a lot of the ideas now

- _libssh2_channel_write: removed 32500 size limit
  
  Neither _libssh2_channel_write nor sftp_write now have the 32500 size
  limit anymore and instead the channel writing function now has its own
  logic to send data in multiple calls until everything is sent.

- send_existing: don't tell parent to return when drained
  
  That will just cause unnecessary code execution.

- _libssh2_channel_write: general code cleanup
  
  simplified the function and removed some unused struct fields

- _libssh2_transport_send: replaces _libssh2_transport_write
  
  The new function takes two data areas, combines them and sends them as a
  single SSH packet. This allows several functions to allocate and copy
  less data.
  
  I also found and fixed a mixed up use of the compression function
  arguments that I introduced in my rewrite in a recent commit.

- scp_write_nonblock: use select() instead of busyloop
  
  Make this example nicer by not busylooping.

- send_existing: clear olen when the data is sent off

- _libssh2_transport_write: allow 256 extra bytes around the packet

- _libssh2_transport_write: remade to send without malloc

- compress: compression disabled by default
  
  We now allow libssh2_session_flag() to enable compression with a new
  flag and I added documentation for the previous LIBSSH2_FLAG_SIGPIPE
  flag which I wasn't really aware of!

- comp: split the compress function
  
  It is now made into two separate compress and decompress functions. In
  preparation for upcoming further modficications.

Daniel Stenberg (11 Oct 2010)
- scp_recv: improved treatment of channel_read() returning zero
  
  As a zero return code from channel_read() is not an error we must make
  sure that the SCP functions deal with that properly. channel_read()
  always returns 0 if the channel is EOFed already so we check for EOF
  after 0-reads to be able to return error properly.

- libssh2_session_methods.3: detail what can be asked for

- compression: send zlib before none
  
  As the list of algorithms in a preferred order we should send zlib
  before none to increase the chances that the server will let us do
  compression.

- compress: faster check, better return codes
  
  In the transport functions we avoid a strcmp() now and just check a
  boolean instead.
  
  The compress/decompress function's return code is now acknowledged and
  used as actual return code in case of failures.

- libssh2_session_handshake: replaces libssh2_session_startup()
  
  The function libssh2_session_startup() is now considered deprecated due
  to the portability issue with the socket argument.
  libssh2_session_handshake() is the name of the replacement.

- libssh2_socket_t: now externally visible
  
  In preparation for upcominig changes, the libssh2_socket_t type is now
  typedef'ed in the public header.

- _libssh2_transport_drain: removed
  
  This function proved not to be used nor useful.

- _libssh2_channel_write: don't iterate over transport writes
  
  When a call to _libssh2_transport_write() succeeds, we must return from
  _libssh2_channel_write() to allow the caller to provide the next chunk
  of data.
  
  We cannot move on to send the next piece of data that may already have
  been provided in this same function call, as we risk getting EAGAIN for
  that and we can't return information both about sent data as well as
  EAGAIN. So, by returning short now, the caller will call this function
  again with new data to send.

- _libssh2_transport_write: updated documentation blurb

- _libssh2_transport_write: remove fprintf remainder
  
  Mistake from previous debugging

- session: improved errors
  
  Replaced -1/SOCKET_NONE errors with appropriate error defines instead.
  
  Made the verbose trace output during banner receiving less annoying for
  non-blocking sessions.

- crypt_init: use correct error define

- _libssh2_error: hide EAGAIN for non-blocking sessions
  
  In an attempt to make the trace output less cluttered for non-blocking
  sessions the error function now avoids calling the debug function if the
  error is the EAGAIN and the session is non-blocking.

- agent: use better error defines

- comp_method_zlib_init: use correct error defines

- transport: better error codes
  
  LIBSSH2_SOCKET_NONE (-1) should no longer be used as error code as it is
  (too) generic and we should instead use specific and dedicated error
  codes to better describe the error.

- channel: return code and _libssh2_error cleanup
  
  Made sure that all transport_write() call failures get _libssh2_error
  called.

- _libssh2_channel_write: limit to 32700 bytes
  
  The well known and used ssh server Dropbear has a maximum SSH packet
  length at 32768 by default. Since the libssh2 design current have a
  fixed one-to-one mapping from channel_write() to the packet size created
  by transport_write() the previous limit of 32768 in the channel layer
  caused the transport layer to create larger packets than 32768 at times
  which Dropbear rejected forcibly (by closing the connection).
  
  The long term fix is of course to remove the hard relation between the
  outgoing SSH packet size and what the input length argument is in the
  transport_write() function call.

- libssh.h: add more dedicated error codes

- SCP: allow file names with bytes > 126
  
  When parsing the SCP protocol and verifying that the data looks like a
  valid file name, byte values over 126 must not be consider illegal since
  UTF-8 file names will use such codes.

Daniel Stenberg (2 Aug 2010)
- example: treat the libssh2_channel_read() return code properly
  
  A short read is not an error. Only negative values are errors!

- libssh2_wait_socket: reset error code to "leak" EAGAIN less
  
  Since libssh2 often sets LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN internally before
  _libssh2_wait_socket is called, we can decrease some amount of
  confusion in user programs by resetting the error code in this function
  to reduce the risk of EAGAIN being stored as error when a blocking
  function returns.

- _libssh2_wait_socket: poll needs milliseconds
  
  As reported on the mailing list, the code path using poll() should
  multiple seconds with 1000 to get milliseconds, not divide!

- typedef: make ssize_t get typedef without LIBSSH2_WIN32
  
  The condition around the ssize_t typedef depended on both LIBSSH2_WIN32

  _MSC_VER only. It also makes it nicer so libssh2-using code builds fine
  without having custom defines.

  session_free: free more data to avoid memory leaks

- channel_free: ignore problems with channel_close()
  
  As was pointed out in bug #182, we must not return failure from
  _libssh2_channel_free() when _libssh2_channel_close() returns an error
  that isn't EAGAIN. It can effectively cause the function to never go
  through, like it did now in the case where the socket was actually
  closed but socket_state still said LIBSSH2_SOCKET_CONNECTED.
  
  I consider this fix the right thing as it now also survives other
  errors, even if making sure socket_state isn't lying is also a good
  idea.

- publickey_list_free: no return value from a void function
  
  Fixed a compiler warning I introduced previously when checking input
  arguments more. I also added a check for the other pointer to avoid NULL
  pointer dereferences.

  handshake: Compression enabled at the wrong time
  
  In KEXINIT messages, the client and server agree on, among other
  things, whether to use compression. This method agreement occurs
  in src/kex.c's kex_agree_methods() function. However, if
  compression is enabled (either client->server, server->client, or
  both), then the compression layer is initialized in
  kex_agree_methods() -- before NEWKEYS has been received.
  
  Instead, the initialization of the compression layer should
  happen after NEWKEYS has been received. This looks to occur
  insrc/kex.c's diffie_hellman_sha1(), which even has the comment:
  
      /* The first key exchange has been performed,
  
          switch to active crypt/comp/mac mode */
  
  There, after NEWKEYS is received, the cipher and mac algorithms
  are initialized, and that is where the compression should be
  initialized as well.
  
  The current implementation fails if server->client compression is
  enabled because most server implementations follow OpenSSH's
  lead, where compression is initialized after NEWKEYS. Since the
  server initializes compression after NEWKEYS, but libssh2
  initializes compression after KEXINIT (i.e. before NEWKEYS), they
  are out of sync.

  userauth_hostbased_fromfile: packet length too short
  
  The packet length calculated in src/userauth.c's
  userauth_hostbased_fromfile() function is too short by 4 bytes;
  it forgets to add four bytes for the length of the hostname.
  This causes hostbased authentication to fail, since the server
  will read junk data.
  
  verified against proftpd's mod_sftp module

- _libssh2_userauth_publickey: reject method names longer than the data
  
  This functions get the method length by looking at the first 32
  bit of data, and I now made it not accept method lengths that are
  longer than the whole data set is, as given in the dedicated
  function argument.
  
  This was detected when the function was given bogus public key
  data as an ascii string, which caused the first 32bits to create
  a HUGE number.

- NULL resistance: make more public functions survive NULL pointer input
  
  Sending in NULL as the primary pointer is now dealt with by more
  public functions. I also narrowed the userauth.c code somewhat to
  stay within 80 columns better.

- agent: make libssh2_agent_userauth() work blocking properly
  
  previously it would always work in a non-blocking manner

- SFTP: limit write() to not produce overly large packets
  
  sftp_write() now limits how much data it gets at a time even more
  than before. Since this function creates a complete outgoing
  packet based on what gets passed to it, it is crucial that it
  doesn't create too large packets.
  
  With this method, there's also no longer any problem to use very
  large buffers in your application and feed that to libssh2. I've
  done numerous tests now with uploading data over SFTP using 100K
  buffers and I've had no problems with that.

- scp_write_nonblock: add transfer time info
  
  Using the same timing logic and output format as
  sftp_write_nonblock allows us to very easily run benchmarks on
  SCP vs SFTP uploads using libssh2.

- sftp_write_nonblock: select() on socket, use *BIG* buffer, time transfer
  
  The select() is just to make it nicer so that it doesn't
  crazy-loop on EAGAIN. The buffer size thing is mostly to verify
  that this really work as supposed.
  
  Transfer timing is just a minor thing, but it can just as well be
  there and help us time and work on performance easier using out
  of the box examples.

- agent: use _libssh2_error() when returning errors
  
  As pointed out in bug report #173, this module basically never
  used _libssh2_error() which made it work inconstently with other
  parts of the libssh2 code base. This is my first take at making
  this code more in line with the rest.

- inputchecks: make lots of API functions check for NULL pointers
  
  If an application accidentally provides a NULL handle pointer to
  the channel or sftp public functions, they now return an error
  instead of segfaulting.

- libssh2_channel_eof: clarify that it returns negative on errors

- SFTP: keep the sftp error code as 32 bit
  
  'last_errno' holds to the error code from the SFTP protocol and
  since that is 32 bits on the wire there's no point in using a
  long for this internally which is larger on some platforms.

- agent: make the code better deal with unexpected code flows
  
  agent->ops gets initialized by the libssh2_agent_connect() call
  but we need to make sure that we don't segfault even if a bad
  sequence of function calls is used.

Alexander Lamaison (10 Jun 2010)
- Better handling of invalid key files.
  
  Passing an invalid public key to libssh2_userauth_publickey_fromfile_ex
  triggered an assertion.  Replaced this with a runtime check that rejects
  obviously invalid key data.

- version: we start working on 1.2.7 now

Version 1.2.6 (10 Jun 2010)

- RELEASE-NOTES: 1.2.6 details added

Guenter Knauf (10 Jun 2010)
- fixed libssh2.dsw to use the generated libssh2.dsp; removed old *.dsp files.

- moved MSVC strdup define to libssh2_config.h which we include already.

- added missing source files to src/NMakefile.

Daniel Stenberg (8 Jun 2010)
- libssh2_poll: refer to poll(3) and select(3) instead

- example: fix strdup() for MSVC compiles
  
  MSVC has a _strdup() that we better use. This was reported in bug

- SFTP: fail init SFTP if session isn't authenticated
  
  Alexander Lamaison filed bug #172
  (http://trac.libssh2.org/ticket/172), and pointed out that SFTP
  init would do bad if the session isn't yet authenticated at the
  time of the call, so we now check for this situation and returns
  an error if detected. Calling sftp_init() at this point is bad
  usage to start with.

- direct_tcpip: bring back inclusion of libssh2_config.h
  
  In order to increase portability of this example, I'm bringing
  the inclusion of libssh2_config.h back, and I also added an
  require that header for this example to compile.
  
  I also made all code lines fit within 80 columns.

Guenter Knauf (3 Jun 2010)
- cast away a warning.

- moved CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE define up so its defined before the winsock headers are included.

- fixed platform detection for MingW32 test makefile.

- MingW32 has gettimeofday() implemented, so proper ifdef this function here.

- removed MSVC ifdef since seems we can use __int64 still with latest headers.

- changed copyright notice for MinW32 and NetWare binaries.

- cleaned up MSVC ifdefs which where spreaded over 3 places.

- added uint8_t typedef for NetWare CLIB platform.

- if the function declaration gets changed the header should be changed too.

- this is MSVC specific and doesnt apply for all Win32 compilers;
  the uint8_t typedef clashes with MingW32 headers.

- updated MingW32 makefiles for latest dependency lib versions.

- updated NetWare makefiles for latest dependency lib versions.

Dan Fandrich (30 May 2010)
- Fixed compiling with libgcrypt
  
  A change of parameter types from unsigned long to size_t was
  missed in the prototype in libgcrypt.h

Daniel Stenberg (28 May 2010)
- statvfs: use libssh2_sftp_statvfs only, no "_ex"
  
  As the long-term goal is to get rid of the extensive set of
  macros from the API we can just as well start small by not adding
  new macros when we add new functions. Therefore we let the
  function be libssh2_sftp_statvfs() plainly without using an _ex
  suffix.
  
  I also made it use size_t instead of unsigned int for the string
  length as that too is a long-term goal for the API.

  made a mistake when I added the _libssh2_store_str() call before
  and I made a slightly different patch than what he suggested.
  Based purely on taste.

- Change magic port number for generic knownhost check.
  
  libssh2_knownhost_checkp took 0 as a magic port number that indicated
  a 'generic' check should be performed.  However, 0 is a valid port
  number in its own right so this commit changes the magic value to any
  negative int.

Peter Stuge (3 May 2010)
- Do proper keyboard-interactive user dialog in the sftp.c example

Daniel Stenberg (3 May 2010)
- added to tarball: libssh2_knownhost_checkp.3

- knownhost: support [host]:port in knownhost file
  
  OpenSSH has ways to add hosts to the knownhosts file that include
  a specific port number which makes the key associated with only
  that specific host+port pair. libssh2 previously did not support
  this, and I was forced to add a new function to the API to
  properly expose this ability to applications:
  libssh2_knownhost_checkp()
  
  To *add* such hosts to the knownhosts file, you make sure to pass
  on the host name in that manner to the libssh2_knownhost_addc()
  function.

- init/exit: mention these were added in 1.2.5

- libssh2_knownhost_check docs: correct the prototype

- examples: avoid use of uninitialized variable 'sock'

- KEX: stop pretending we negotiate language
  
  There was some stub-like parts of an implementation for
  implementing kex language negotiation that caused clang-analyzer
  to warn and as it did nothing I've now removed the dead code.

- Uninitialized argument

- sftpdir: removed dead assignment

- Makefile.am: include the VMS-specific config header as well

- [Jose Baars brought this change]

  Add VMS specific libssh2_config.h

- fix Value stored to 's' is never read warning
  
  and moved variable declaration of s to be more local

- kexinit: simplify the code and avoid scan-build warning
  
  Previously it would say "Value stored to 's' is never read" due
  fourth increment of 's'.

Alexander Lamaison (28 Apr 2010)
- Removed unecessary brackets.

- Changed sftp_attrsize macro to a static function.

Daniel Stenberg (28 Apr 2010)
- release: include the VMS-specific files

- sftp_attrsize: protect the macro argument with proper parentheses

- ssh2_agent: avoid using 'session' uninitialized on failures

- examples: remove assignments of variable rc that's never used

- publickey_init: remove useless variable increment

- hostkey_method_ssh_rsa_init: remove useless variable increment

- packet_x11_open: removed useless variable increment
  
  and made the declaration of a variable more local

- packet_queue_listener: removed useless variable increment
  
  and made the declaration of a variable more local

- sftp_read: move a read_responses array to where its used
  
  I find that this increases readability since the array is used
  only in the function call just immediately below and nowhere
  else.

- sftp_readdir: turn a small array static const and move it

- sftp_attrsize: converted function to a macro
  
  This way, the macro can evaluate a static number at compile time
  for two out of four uses, and it probably runs faster for the
  other two cases too.

- sftp_open: deal with short channel_write calls
  
  This was an old TODO that just wasn't done before. If
  channel_write returns short, that is not an error.

- sftp_open: clean up, better check of input data
  
  The clang-analyzer report made it look into this function and
  I've went through it to remove a potential use of an
  uninitialized variable and I also added some validation of input
  data received from the server.
  
  In general, lots of more code in this file need to validate the
  input before assuming it is correct: there are servers out there
  that have bugs or just have another idea of how to do the SFTP
  protocol.

- bugfix: avoid using the socket if it failed to create one

- bugfix: potential use of NULL pointer

- libssh2_userauth_password_ex: clarify errors somewhat
  
  The errors mentioned in this man page are possible return codes
  but not necessarily the only return codes that this can return.
  
  Also reformatted the typ prototypes somewhat.

- examples: fixed and made them more similar
  
  The channel read/write functions can return 0 in legitimate cases
  without it being an error, and we need to loop properly if they
  return short.

- [Jose Baars brought this change]

  VMS port of libssh2; changes in the libssh2 common code

- Makefile: added the two news headers userauth.h and session.h

- cleanup: prefer the internal functions
  
  To get the blocking vs non-blocking to work as smooth as possible
  and behave better internally, we avoid using the external
  interfaces when calling functions internally.
  
  Renamed a few internal functions to use _libssh2 prefix when not
  being private within a file, and removed the libssh2_ for one
  that was private within the file.

- session_free: remove dead code

- libssh2_publickey_init: fixed to work better non-blocking
  
  This was triggered by a clang-analyzer complaint that turned out
  to be valid, and it made me dig deeper and fix some generic non-
  blocking problems I disovered in the code.
  
  While cleaning this up, I moved session-specific stuff over to a
  new session.h header from the libssh2_priv.h header.

- channel: reduce duplicated free and returns
  
  Simplified the code by trying to free data and return on a single
  spot.

- channel: make variables more local
  
  By making 'data' and 'data_len' more local in several places in
  this file it will be easier to spot how they are used and we'll
  get less risks to accidentally do bad things with them.

Mikhail Gusarov (24 Apr 2010)
- Fix typos in manpages, catched by Lintian

Daniel Stenberg (24 Apr 2010)
- channel_request_pty: simplify the code
  
  clang-analyzer pointed out how 'data' could be accessed as a NULL
  pointer if the wrong state was set, and while I don't see that
  happen in real-life the code flow is easier to read and follow by
  moving the LIBSSH2_FREE() call into the block that is supposed to
  deal with the data pointer anyway.

- libssh2_channel_process_startup: simplify the code
  
  clang-analyzer pointed out how 'data' could be accessed as a NULL
  pointer if the wrong state was set, and while I don't see that
  happen in real-life the code flow is easier to read and follow by
  moving the LIBSSH2_FREE() call into the block that is supposed to
  deal with the data pointer anyway.

- sftp_close_handle: add precation to not access NULL pointer
  
  clang-analyzer pointed this out as a "Pass-by-value argument in
  function call is undefined" but while I can't see exactly how
  this can ever happen in reality I think a little check for safety
  isn't such a bad thing here.

- scp_write_nonblock: Value stored to 'nread' is never read

- scp_write: Value stored to 'ptr' is never read

- scp_write_nonblock: Value stored to 'ptr' is never read

- sftp_mkdir: less silly output but show failures

- [Jose Baars brought this change]

  VMS port of libssh2 including VMS specific build procedures

- two variable types changes, made lines less than 80 columns
  
  The two variable type changes are only to match type variable
  fields actually read from the binary protocol.

- remove check for negative padding_length
  
  It was silly, since it is read as an unsigned char...

- hostkey_method_ssh_dss_init: Value stored to 's' is never read

- libssh2_banner_set: avoid unnecessary increment and explain code

- agent_transact_unix: remove unused variable

- remove two unnecessary increments

- more code converted to use _libssh2_store_*()

- libssh2_publickey_list_fetch: removed unused variables

- libssh2_publickey_init: remove unused variables

- libssh2_scp_send64: added to API to provide large file transfers
  
  The previously existing libssh2_scp_send_ex() function has no way
  to send files that are larger than 'size_t' which on 32bit
  systems mean 4GB. This new API uses a libssh2_int64_t type and
  should thus on most modern systems be able to send enormous
  files.

- sftp_init: remove unused variables and assignments

- libssh2_knownhost_check: Value stored to 'keylen' is never read

- hostkey: fix compiler warning

- remove unused variable

- data types: convert more to use size_t and uint32_t

- channel: variable type cleanups

- cleanups: better binary packet gen, size_t fixes and PACKET_* removal
  
  I'll introduce a new internal function set named
  
   _libssh2_store_u32
   _libssh2_store_u64
   _libssh2_store_str
  
  That can be used all through the library to build binary outgoing
  packets.  Using these instead of the current approach removes
  hundreds of lines from the library while at the same time greatly
  enhances readability. I've not yet fully converted everything to
  use these functions.
  
  I've converted LOTS of 'unsigned long' to 'size_t' where
  data/string lengths are dealt with internally. This is The Right
  Thing and it will help us make the transition to our
  size_t-polished API later on as well.
  
  I'm removing the PACKET_* error codes. They were originally
  introduced as a set of separate error codes from the transport
  layer, but having its own set of errors turned out to be very
  awkward and they were then converted into a set of #defines that
  simply maps them to the global libssh2 error codes instead. Now,
  I'l take the next logical step and simply replace the PACKET_*
  defines with the actual LIBSSH2_ERROR_* defines. It will increase
  readability and decrease confusion.
  
  I also separated packet stuff into its own packet.h header file.

- clarified the return code

- rename libssh2_error to the correct _libssh2_error
  
  We reserve ^libssh2_ for public symbols and we use _libssh2 as
  prefix for internal ones. I fixed the intendation of all these
  edits with emacs afterwards, which then changed it slightly more
  than just _libssh2_error() expressions but I didn't see any
  obvious problems.

- data type cleanup: made lots of code use size_t etc
  
  A lot of code used 'unsigned long' and the likes when it should
  rather just use plain 'int' or use size_t for data lengths.

- wait_socket: make c89 compliant and use two fd_sets for select()

- sftp_readdir: always zero terminate, detail the return code
  
  I also added a description for the 'longentry' field which was
  previously undocumented!

- sftp_readdir: simplified and bugfixed
  
  This function no longer has any special purpose code for the
  single entry case, as it was pointless.
  
  The previous code would overflow the buffers with an off-by-one
  in case the file name or longentry data fields received from the
  server were exactly as long as the buffer provided to
  libssh2_sftp_readdir_ex.
  
  We now make sure that libssh2_sftp_readdir_ex() ALWAYS zero
  terminate the buffers it fills in.
  
  The function no longer calls the libssh2_* function again, but
  properly uses the internal sftp_* instead.

- channel/transport: we now drain the outgoing send buffer when we ignore EAGAIN
  
  When we ignore the EAGAIN from the transport layer within channel_write, we
  now drain the outgoing transport layer buffer so that remainders in that
  won't cause any problems in the next invoke of _libssh2_transport_write()

- channel_write: if data has been sent, don't return EAGAIN
  
  When sending data in a loop, we must not return EAGAIN if we
  managed to send data in an earlier round. This was reported in
  bug #126 => http://libssh2.stuge.se/ticket/126

- 1.2.6: clean the RELEASE-NOTES for next release round

- NEWS: add the stuff from the version 1.2.5 RELEASE-NOTES

Version 1.2.5 (13 Apr 2010)

Daniel Stenberg (13 Apr 2010)
- channel_close: no longer wait for the SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_CLOSE message
  
  As the packet may simply not arrive we cannot have the close
  function wait for it unconditionally.

- less code duplication in the poll vs select code flows
  
  libssh2_keepalive_send and libssh2_session_block_directions are
  now used outside of the #ifdef blocks.

- make it C90 compliant

- updated with all changes and bugs since 1.2.4

- Added LIBSSH2_SFTP_S_IS***() macros and updated docs
  
  libssh2_sftp_fstat_ex.3 is now extended quite a lot to describe a
  lot of the struct and the bits it uses and how to test for them.

- sftp_init() deal with _libssh2_channel_write() returns short
  
  When _libssh2_channel_write() is asked to send off 9 bytes, the
  code needs to deal with the situation where less than 9 bytes
  were sent off and prepare to send the remaining piece at a later
  time.

- handle a NULL password as if it was ""
  
  libssh2_userauth_publickey_fromfile_ex() takes a "passphrase"
  but didn't deal with it being set to NULL.

- Reduce used window sizes by factor 10
  
  As reported in bug report #166 http://libssh2.stuge.se/ticket/166
  by 'ptjm', the maximum window size must be less crazy for libssh2
  to do better with more server implementations. I did not do any
  testing to see how this changes raw SCP performance, but the
  maximum window size is still almost 4MB. This also has the upside
  that libssh2 will use less memory.

Peter Stuge (28 Mar 2010)
- Correctly clear blocking flag after sending multipart packet
  
  commit 7317edab61d2179febc38a2c2c4da0b951d74cbc cleared the outbound
  blocking bit when send_existing() returned PACKET_NONE and *ret=0, as
  opposed to before even calling send_existing(), but because *ret=1 when
  sending parts 2..n of an existing packet, the bit would only be cleared
  when calling libssh2_transport_write() for a new packet.
  
  Clear the direction flag after the final part of a packet has been sent.

Daniel Stenberg (24 Mar 2010)
- Added man page for libssh2_knownhost_addc()
  
  Added mention in libssh2_knownhost_add() docs that
  libssh2_knownhost_addc() is the preferred function now.

- at next soname bump remove libssh2_knownhost_add()

- ignore TAGS ("make tags" makes them)

- fix memory leak
  
  we must not assign the pointer a NULL since it keeps allocated
  data and at least parts of an error string

- fixed the pattern for avoiding the poll check
  
  added some comments about known problems with poll on darwin

- avoid checking for poll on some systems
  
  darwin and interix are known to have broken poll implementations
  so we skip the check on those and thus have them use select
  unconditionally

- ignore libssh2.dsp

- silence picky compiler warnings

- silence picky compiler warnings

- removed libssh2_error()'s forth argument
  
  libssh2_error() no longer allocates a string and only accepts a const
  error string. I also made a lot of functions use the construct of
  return libssh2_error(...) instead of having one call to
  libssh2_error() and then a separate return call. In several of those
  cases I then also changed the former -1 return code to a more
  detailed one - something that I think will not change behaviors
  anywhere but it's worth keeping an eye open for any such.

- Send and receive channel EOF before sending SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_CLOSE
  
  Sending SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_CLOSE without channel EOF is explicitly allowed
  in RFC 4254, but some non-conforming servers will hang or time out when
  the channel is closed before EOF.
  
  Other common clients send and receive EOF before closing, there are no
  drawbacks, and some servers need it to work correctly.

Alexander Lamaison (26 Feb 2010)
- Style improvements to knownhost error handling.
  
  Made improvements as suggested by Peter Stuge: http://www.libssh2.org/mail/libssh2-devel-archive-2010-02/0161.shtml.

- Call libssh2_error for every knownhost API failure.
  
  The libssh2 API calls should set the last error code and a message when
  returning a failure by calling libssh2_error.  This changeset adds these
  calls to the libssh2_knownhost_* API as well as libssh2_base64_decode.
  
  This change also makes libssh2_error into a function rather than a macro.
  Its implementation is moved to misc.c.  This function returns the error
  code passed to it allowing callers to return the error value directly
  without duplicating the error code.

- Fix LIBSSH2_ALLOC checks.
  
  These appear to be cut-and paste errors where the wrong variable is checked
  for NULLness after calling LIBSSH2_ALLOC.

Simon Josefsson (23 Feb 2010)
- Silence compiler warning.

- Make it portable; test uses = for string comparison (not ==).  Indent.

Alexander Lamaison (22 Feb 2010)
- libssh2_knownhost_del: fix write to freed memory.
  
  When removing a known host, libssh2_knownhost_del would remove the node from the linked list, free its memory and then overwrite the struct parameter (which indicated which node to remove) with 0.  However, this struct is actually allocated within the just-freed node meaning we're writing to freed memory.  This made Windows very upset.
  
  The fix is simply to overwrite the struct first before freeing the memory.

Daniel Stenberg (21 Feb 2010)
- show more verbose error when SCP send fails

- libssh2_socket_t is done, a library-free function is needed

- add missing libssh2_error() calls
  
  To make sure the public API is functional and that the
  BLOCK_ADJUST_ERRNO() macro works correctly we MUST make sure to
  call libssh2_error() when we return errors.

- fix memory leak in userauth_keyboard_interactive()
  
  Mr anonymous in bug #125 pointed out that the userauth_keyboard_interactive()
  function does in fact assign the same pointer a second time to a new allocated
  buffer without properly freeing the previous one, which caused a memory leak.

- added missing error codes
  
  To allow the libssh2_session_last_error() function to work as
  documented, userauth_password() now better makes sure to call
  libssh2_error() everywhere before it returns error.

Daniel Stenberg (15 Feb 2010)
- mention the new man pages for macros

- added man pages for API macros
  
  all #defined macros in the public headers are considered to be part
  of the API and I've generated individual man pages for each of them
  to A) make it easier to figure out what each function/macro actually
  is for so that automated lookups work better and for B) make sure we
  have all public functions document (both macros and functions) to
  make it easier for us to work away from all the macros in a future
  release.

  Fix Tru64 socklen_t compile issue with example/direct_tcpip.c
  
  Building libssh2-1.2.3 on Tru64 fails at line 48 and 166 because socklen_t
  isn't defined on Tru64 unless _POSIX_PII_SOCKET is defined.
  
  This patch updates configure.ac to add -D_POSIX_PII_SOCKET when building
  on Tru64 platform(s).

  Resolve compile issues on Solaris x64 and UltraSPARC
  
  Solaris builds of libssh2-1.2.3 failed on both x64 and UltraSPARC

- Small documentation fix after Dave's _USERAUTH_FAILURE improvement

- [Dave McCaldon brought this change]

  Handle SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_FAILURE for password and kbd-int authentication
  
  Neither libssh2_userauth_password_ex() nor
  libssh2_userauth_keyboard_interactive_ex() would return a login failure
  error if the server responded with a SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_FAILURE, instead
  you would see whatever previous error had occurred, typically
  LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN.
  
  This patch changes error code -18 to LIBSSH2_ERROR_AUTHENTICATION_FAILED
  and makes LIBSSH2_ERROR_PUBLICKEY_UNRECOGNIZED an alias for
  LIBSSH2_ERROR_AUTHENTICATION_FAILED.  In addition, new logic in
  userauth_password() properly handles SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_FAILURE and both
  this function and userauth_keyboard_interactive() now properly return
  LIBSSH2_ERROR_AUTHENTICATION_FAILED.

- [Dave McCaldon brought this change]

  Fix trace context lookup in libssh2_debug()
  
  The trace context is actually a bitmask so that tracing output can be
  controlled by setting a bitmask using libssh2_trace().  However, the logic
  in libssh2_debug() that converted the context to a string was using the
  context value as an array index.  Because the code used a bounds check on
  the array, there was never a danger of a crash, but you would certainly
  either get the wrong string, or "unknown".
  
  This patch adds a lookup that iterates over the context strings and uses
  it's index to check for the corresponding bit in the context.

  Pass user context through libssh2_trace_sethandler() to callback

Alexander Lamaison (30 Dec 2009)
- Fixed memory leak in userauth_publickey().
  
  userauth_publickey_fromfile() reads the key from a
  file using file_read_publickey() which returns two
  allocated strings, the decoded key and the key
  method (such as "ssh-dss").  The latter can be
  derived from the former but returning both avoids a
  later allocation while doing so.
  
  Older versions of userauth_publickey_fromfile() used
  this method string directly but when
  userauth_publickey() was factored out of
  userauth_publickey_fromfile() it derived the method
  from the key itself.  This resulted in the method
  being allocated twice.
  
  This fix, which maintains the optimisation that
  avoids an extra allocation, changes
  userauth_publickey() so it doesn't allocate and
  derive the method when userauth_pblc_method already
  has a value.

- Another transport layer fix for bogus -39 (LIBSSH2_ERROR_BAD_USE) errors
  
  Commit 683aa0f6b52fb1014873c961709102b5006372fc made send_existing() send
  more than just the second part of a packet when the kernel did not accept
  the full packet, but the function still overlooked the SSH protocol
  overhead in each packet, often 48 bytes.
  
  If only the last few bytes of a packet remained, then the packet would
  erroneously be considered completely sent, and the next call to write
  more data in the session would return a -39 error.

Daniel Stenberg (6 Dec 2009)
- move local variable to be more localized

- fixed some indent mistakes

Peter Stuge (6 Dec 2009)
- Fix padding in ssh-dss signature blob encoding
  
  DSA signatures consist of two 160-bit integers called r and s. In ssh-dss
  signature blobs r and s are stored directly after each other in binary
  representation, making up a 320-bit (40 byte) string. (See RFC4253 p14.)
  
  The crypto wrappers in libssh2 would either pack r and s incorrectly, or
  fail, when at least one integer was small enough to be stored in 19 bytes
  or less.
  
  The patch ensures that r and s are always stored as two 160 bit numbers.

- Don't always clear write direction blocking flag
  
  When libssh2_transport_write() is called to continue sending a
  partially sent packet the write direction flag must not be cleared
  until the previous packet has been completely sent, or the app would
  hang if the packet still isn't sent completely, since select() gets
  called by the internal blocking emulation layer in libssh2 but would
  then not be watching the socket for writability.
  
  Clear the flag only once processing of previous packet data is
  complete and a new packet is about to be prepared.

- Ensure that win32/libssh2.dsp will be generated with CRLF line endings
  
  First, win32/msvcproj.{head,foot} are now committed with CRLF line endings,
  and .gitattributes specifies that these should not be changed on checkout or
  commit. These are win32 files so it makes sense to store them with native
  line endings.
  
  Second, the rules for generating libssh2.dsp and libssh2.vcproj are changed
  so that the full file contents passes through awk, which strips all CR and
  then prints each line with one CRLF line ending. Stripping CR is important
  to avoid CRCRLF in case the input already comes with CRLF.

- Fix scp examples to loop correctly over libssh2_channel_write()

- Fix transport layer bug causing invalid -39 (LIBSSH2_ERROR_BAD_USE) errors
  
  The channel layer sends packets using the transport layer, possibly
  calling _libssh2_transport_write() many times for each packet.
  
  The transport layer uses the send_existing() helper to send out any
  remaining parts of previous packets before a new packet is started.
  
  The bug made send_existing() consider the entire packet sent as soon as it
  successfully sent the second part of a packet, even if the packet was not
  completely done yet.

Daniel Stenberg (19 Sep 2009)
- [Neil Gierman brought this change]

  Added gettimeofday() function for win32
  
  Neil Gierman's patch adds a gettimeofday() function for win32
  for the libssh2_trace() functionality. The code originates from
  cygwin and was put in the public domain by the author
  Danny Smith <dannysmith@users.sourceforge.net>

- libssh2_channel_read_ex() must return 0 when closed
  
  If the channel is already at EOF or even closed at the end of the
  libssh2_channel_read_ex() function and there's no data to return,
  we need to signal that back. We may have gotten that info while
  draining the incoming transport layer until EAGAIN so we must not
  be fooled by that return code.

Dan Fandrich (16 Sep 2009)
- Ignore tags file

- Some platforms need sys/socket.h included before netinet/in.h.
  Fixed an unused variable compiler warning.

Daniel Stenberg (16 Sep 2009)
- libssh2_channel_wait_closed() could hang
  
  libssh2_channel_wait_closed() had a bad loop waiting for the
  channel to close, as it could easily miss the info and then if
  the socket would be silent from that moment the funtion would
  hang if in blocking-mode or just return EAGAIN wrongly to the
  app. The drain-transport loop now correctly checks if the close
  has arrived.

- make libssh2_scp_send/recv do blocking mode correctly
  
  Somehow I had completely missed to make the libssh2_scp_send/recv
  functions support the blocking mode the correct way so when I
  cleaned up things the other day blocking mode broke for them...
  Fixed now.

Alexander Lamaison (2 Sep 2009)
- Pass private-key to OpenSSL as a filename with BIO_new_file().
  
  This keeps all FILE* handling on the OpenSSL side of the DLL boundary avoiding crashes on Windows while removing the need for libssh2 to read the private key file into memory.  This is now done by OpenSSL which is likely to do a better job of it.

Daniel Stenberg (1 Sep 2009)
- generate and install libssh2.pc
  
  oh these are necessary libssh2.pc changes too

- first take at producing and installing a pkg-config file

- renamed to .ac

- renamed to the modern name "configure.ac"

- always braces and else and brace on the same line removed
  
  I don't follow those particular guidelines myself so I think I'd
  rather remove them here and keep my style than the opposite. As
  I am the most frequent writer of code for the moment.

- _libssh2_channel_write() only sends the 32K first bytes
  
  In theory we could split larger buffers into several smaller
  packets to pass to transport_write(), but for now we instead only
  deal with the first 32K in this call and assume the app will call
  this function again with the rest!  The 32K size is a
  conservative limit based on the text in RFC4253 section 6.1.

- document _libssh2_channel_write's return code

- s/libssh2_channel_write_ex/_libssh2_channel_write internally

- call libssh2_error() when transport_write() returns EAGAIN
  
  _libssh2_channel_write() should never return error without
  libssh2_error() getting called

- clarify that zero can be returned without meaning error

- remove debug leftovers

- channel_read() was changed to _libssh2_channel_read() as lots of
  internal code was changed to use that instead of wrongly using
  libssh2_channel_read_ex(). Some files now need to include
  channel.h to get this proto.
  
  channel_read() calls libssh2_error() properly on transport_read()
  failures
  
  channel_read() was adjusted to not "invent" EAGAIN return code in
  case the transport_read() didn't return it
  
  channel_close() now returns 0 or error code, as
  documented. Previously it would return number of bytes read in
  the last read, which was confusing (and useless).

- changed all return EAGAIN to return the variable instead
  
  I made this change just to easier grep for "return .*EAGAIN" cases
  as they should be very rare or done wrongly. Already worked to find
  a flaw, marked with "TODO FIXME THIS IS WRONG" in channel.c. I also
  fixed a few cases to become more general returns now when we have
  more unified return codes internally.

- _libssh2_channel_write() must not invent EAGAIN situations
  
  it is important that only the transport layer can generate EAGAIN
  error codes so that we limit where we need to set direction bits
  and more. When the local window is too small to send data we simply
  stop trying to send and (risk) returning zero in
  _libssh2_channel_write()

- error code cleanup

- remove all libssh2pack_t leftovers

- removed the libssh2pack_t type
  
  and a minor _libssh2_transport_read() simplification

- fix return codes, shortened a very long function name

- remove use of libssh2_channel_receive_window_adjust
  
  _libssh2_channel_receive_window_adjust is the new replacement that
  is both the correct internal version instead of the external API one,
  and it has the return code flaw fixed. I also fixed more return
  codes to pass long the correct error found.

- more proper return codes, added a missing libssh2_error() call

- clear socket_block_directions bits before send/recv
  
  These two places are the only places where send and recv are called
  outside of transport.c so make sure they clear/set the bits correctly.

- simplified fullpacket, clarified _libssh2_transport_write() comment

- cleaned up _libssh2_packet_add()
  
  removed some code duplication, changed a few return -1 to return
  error codes instead and added a missing libssh2_error() invoke

- convert return -1 instances to return [proper error code]

- simplify code by removing code duplication

- fix several return -1 to return a proper error code
  
  On many places in the code there have been laziness return -1
  statements lying around that should be fixed to return sensible
  error codes. Here's a take at fixing a few offenders.

- change transport to use unified error codes
  
  I added three new public error codes, and then modified the return
  codes we use in the transport layer to use the generic error codes
  so that there won't be any risk of internal confusions due to
  different error code sets.

- changes from int to libssh2_socket_t for sokcets
  
  modified two functions to use libssh2_socket_t instead of int
  when referring to a socket descriptor

- introducing libssh2_socket_t type and fixed iovec for windows
  
  Steven Van Ingelgem introduces libssh2_socket_t as a generic socket
  type to use internally to avoid compiler warnings and mistakes. Also,
  the private struct iovec declaration for windows is now made to look
  like the POSIX struct does.

- linked list changes and minor bug fixes

- linked list code is now converted to new functions

- remove superfluous braces and re-indent somewhat

- move over lots of code to the _libssh2_list_* functions
  
  and I fixed a few minor bugs at the same time

- converted listeners to the linked list functions

- moved the handling of SFTP handles to new linked list code
  
  Each SFTP file handle is now handled by the "mother-struct"
  using the generic linked list functions. The goal is to move
  all custom linked list code to use this set of functions.
  
  I also moved the list declarations to the misc.h where they
  belong and made misc.h no longer include libssh2_priv.h itself
  since now libssh2_priv.h needs misc.h...
  
  In misc.c I added a #if 0'ed _libssh2_list_insert() function
  because I ended up writing one, and I believe we may need it here
  too once we move over more stuff to use the _libssh2_list* family.

- correct the comment for _libssh2_list_add()
  
  it adds the new node to the _end_ of the list

- revert parts of the b95fe985af3c80a2babcaaaf7da69a15b1237c49 commit
  
  Alexander Lamaison tracked down that my previous commit broke SFTP
  reads in some aspects. The reversion now gets back to always recv()
  until EAGAIN is returned so that the code no longer treats a short
  read as an indication that it is "enough for now".
  
  The bad commit in particular had another independent change included,
  which is to clear the direction-bits first in the transport read
  and write functions, but this reversion does not revert that change.
  Clearing those bits first is a good thing.

- Fix some nroff formatting
  
  Patch by Sofian Brabez

Alexander Lamaison (2 Aug 2009)
- Replaced calls to OpenSSL FILE-pointer functions.
  
  Passing a FILE* argument across a DLL boundary causes problems on Windows.  Instead the keys are read into memory by libssh2 and passed to the OpenSSL functions as BIO* arguments.

Daniel Stenberg (31 Jul 2009)
- Add missing names
  
  I went over the NEWS and git log outputs and added all mentioned
  contributors through the project's history. I want us to make an
  effort to give credit to everyone who contributes, big or small.

- fix the C99 variadic macro use for _libssh2_debug()
  
  George Neill pointed out that the C99 vararg marcro use was
  wrong, and I edited his suggested patch slightly and unified
  both prec99-GCC and C99 into the same macro.

- Include RELEASE-NOTES in the release package

- Release notes for the pending release
  
  I hope to maintain this file during development so that we also add
  changes and bugfixes to it when we change things. Makes the daily
  snapshots better and makes less of a hurdle when the release day
  comes.

- bad debugdump() causes SIGSEGV, partial sends not done right
  
  The anonymous bug report #2822910 pointed out that debugdump() was
  stupidly called within the send_existing() function. At closer
  inspection was the report not only right, but it also revealed
  another problem to me: when the _libssh2_send() function returns
  after sending only a part of the buffer, it would then misbehave.
  This probably is very rare though, which must be the reason we
  haven't seen a bigger problem with this.

Simon Josefsson (28 Jul 2009)
- Silcen compiler warnings.

Daniel Stenberg (27 Jul 2009)
- added two new issues to fix: socket type and better windowing
  
  * make sure the windowing code adapts better to slow situations so that it
    doesn't then use as much memory as today
  
  * Introduce a 'libssh2_socket_t' type for sockets in internal code

- remove superfluous check for large packets
  
  as we're already doing the correct check further down anyway there's no point
  in doing the (wrong) check further up as well. Paul Veldkamp pointed this out.

Simon Josefsson (22 Jul 2009)
- Fix make distcheck problems.

Daniel Stenberg (18 Jul 2009)
- parts of the previous VS project files commit

- From: Neil Gierman <ngierman@roadrunn.com>
  
  Makefile changes to generate MSVS project files
  
  - I integrated the libssh2_lib.dsp and libssh2_dll.dsp into a single
  libssh2.dsp with different targets for lib vs dll
  - Since I run Visual Studio 2008 with VC++9 I did not do vcproj files since
  I would have newer vc8proj.head|foot than what others will be running
  - My patch only has changes to Makefile.am's. I noticed that Makefile.in's
  are included in the daily snapshots but they should be generated from the
  .am's
  - The 3 new files are msvcproj.head and msvcproj.foot for the beginning and
  ending of the dsp file, and a new Makefile.inc that will have the source and
  header file names. NOTE: All new source files will need to be added to
  Makefile.inc and NOT Makefile.am now.
  - I moved the win32 dir before the include dir
  - I modified the dsw file so it points to the new libssh2.dsp project file

- From: Alexander Lamaison <swish@lammy.co.uk>
  Make the public headers includable on their own

- From: Steven Van Ingelgem <steven@vaningelgem.be>
  check first for libtoolize, and then for glibtoolize
  
  Mac OS X (and others?) needs this

- Fix knownhost checking of non-hashed hosts
  
  From: Ben Kibbey <bjk@luxsci.net>

- Fix the functionality again with hashed host names again.
  
  The breakage came with commit 8b46528c0476af50a43b6e619f2db318a0cad194.

- [Peter Stuge brought this change]

  Update mailing list URL to new address

- const'ify two arguments to libssh2_knownhost_check()

- Fix compiler warnings appearing with VS2008. Based on Steven Van Ingelgem's
  patch in #2787839 with a bunch of additional edits by yours truly.

- Applied Francois Dupoux's extra checks for weird packet or padding length in
  incoming packets. We really need to bail out this way on weird input.
  bug report #2814613

- Mark McPherson posted bug report #2815836 pointing out that the custom memory
  functions were not given the correct data as argument. This is now fixed even
  if I personally don't quite grasp why abstract is passed as a pointer to
  pointer all over libssh2...

- Ben Kibbey added a type parameter to the libssh2_session_hostkey() function,
  which hasn't yet been in a public release so changing the API is fine!

- Guenter Knauf fixed this example to build on win32

- corrected (again)

- clarify

- Neil Gierman pointed out in bug report #2809163 that these two files cannot
  include the public libssh2.h header as it breaks the compile on window. I'll
  adapt to this now, but in the long run I think we should rather fix the
  includes so that we _can_ include the public headers properly.

- fixed the length check in knownhost_writeline() since <= is actually good
  enough when the size includes the trailing zero

- After a mention from Ben Kibbey we now let knownhost_writeline() return the
  length of the actual data it returns, excluding the trailing zero. I also
  updated the man page for libssh2_knownhost_writeline() accordingly.

- empty line removed

- Ben Kibbey fixed the hostline() when parsing lines using only one hostname

- Merge branch 'master' of ssh://bagder@git.stuge.se/var/lib/git/libssh2

- Provide a libssh2_scp_send() API for files larger than 4GB (32bit size)

- Olivier Hervieu provided this x11 forwarding example. This is the version
  after my initial cleanup that I posted to the list on May 26th 2009. It still
  has a few ugly spots that should be cleaned up, but until then it's will at
  least be found in the repo. For this reason I don't add this to the makefile.

- New man page for libssh2_session_hostkey(3). We probably need to improve this
  to also return the type of the key.

- Add check for and use of the _REENTRANT define for Solaris so that libssh2
  is then properly thread-safe on that OS. These autuconf macros are straight
  from the cURL project and were mostly written by Yang Tse. They were only
  very slightly edited by me when imported to here.

- [Tor Arntsen brought this change]

  Ignore generated files

- use the correct #if condition for strtoll(), pointed out in bug report

- define the HAVE_LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_API to the version number 1.1.1 to make apps
  know that when this define exists, the API exists. And the version number can
  be used for run-time checks. 1.1.1 is not likely to be the release version as
  I think we'll go with 1.2 instead but 1.1.1 OR LATER should still work.

- libssh2_knownhost_add() got an additional argument: 'store' so that an
  application can get a pointer back to the internal representation of the host
  it just added. Useful for example when the app wants to add a host, and then
  convert that exact same host to a line for storing in a known host file.
  'store' can also be set to NULL to simple not care.

- Added a call to libssh2_knownhost_writefile()
  
  Updated to the slightly modified libssh2_knownhost_check() proto

- "struct libssh2_knownhost" is now part of the internal struct for each known
  host so we now only return pointers to structs instead of having the app
  allocate a full struct
  
  I moved the private struct definition into knownhosts.c instead of exposing it
  wider in libssh2_priv.h
  
  I thus modified the proto for two functions that previously used 'struct
  libssh2_knownhost *' to receive data.

- when a host is added, we must make sure the app also provides a key *type* even
  though we don't use the type in this function

- Added man pages for the two newest members of the knownhosts API family:
  libssh2_knownhost_readline() and libssh2_knownhost_writeline()

- introducing libssh2_knownhost_writeline() and some cleanups to use more
  defined error codes instead of the simplified -1 previously used a little too
  much here

- I think *readline() makes a better name

- clarify that the key "string" needs to be zero terminated too

- introducing libssh2_knownhost_read() that makes libssh2 read a single given
  line
  const'ified a few args to libssh2_knownhost_add() as well

- fix a warning for a comparison mixing signed and unsigned types

- After review/feedback/discussions on the mailing list. Rename two functions:
  
  s/libssh2_knownhost_parsefile/libssh2_knownhost_readfile
  s/libssh2_knownhost_dumpfile/libssh2_knownhost_writefile

- define removed

- LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_TYPE_DEFAULT is not a good idea, scrap it

- Added the initial man pages for the 7 new functions for known host handling

- first shot at implementing libssh2_knownhost_dumpfile() and some minor
  cleanups

- introducing libssh2_knownhost_get() to the public API

- clarified a comment

- slighty better behavior and comments

- remove include since we don't use struct iovec in this file

- These examples no longer need to explictly set the socket to non-blocking state
  as libssh2 itself will always do that by itself.

- add myself as copyright owner

- mention conversion of code to the new linked list code

- remove #if 0'ed code

- clarify the fix, as it wasn't a leak

- spell fix a comment

- Added some clarifying comments on how the 'sftpInit_sftp' and
  'sftpInit_channel' struct fields within the session struct are used. And made
  sure to clear them both correctly when sftp_init() returns instead of at
  shutdown time, as it must not touch them at shutdown time. This should make it
  possible to properly make more than one SFTP handle.

- no need for LIBSSH2_ERROR_MEMORY when LIBSSH2_ERROR_ALLOC already exist!
  added my own copyright line too now

- use LIBSSH2_ERROR_ALLOC instead of introducing a new error code

- clear session->sftpInit_sftp unconditionally

- Fix my recent session->sftpInit_sftp fix which wasn't correct. The memory area
  does not need to be freed (it already gets freed) but clearing the pointer is
  a good idea. And it should be done _after_ the channel_free() call.

- add an assert to help debugging

- Without CVS we must not use cvs tools to generate the changelog. I'm not
  confident enough with git to attempt to make one so I'll just make a dummy for
  now.

-  - Anonymous bug report #2795816 revealed that libssh2_sftp_shutdown() did not
     properly free/cleanup the SFTP handle so libssh2 leaked memory and caused
     an assert() on subsequent libssh2_sftp_init() calls on the same session.

- Fix _libssh2_channel_write(): fixed the write loop to also read from the
  transport layer better, to avoid draining the window size when sending large
  packets. I also fixed the return code for it to return the number of bytes
  handled in this single invoke (and not the cumulative amount).

- First, only try to send max packet size *4 to channel write, as trying to send
  much larger packages only cause internal problems and much larger allocations.
  
  Also fix sftp_write() when _libssh2_channel_write() returns that a packet was
  only partially sent as that is not an error.
  
  Fixed a few error messages to more accurately point out the problem

- If recv() returns something less than the full buffer we know we're done for
  now, so skip looping and doing another read that then simply will cause an
  EAGAIN as it may trick the user into believing things that aren't true.

daniel (14 May 2009)
- remove the old style as it makes little sense to mention here anymore

Daniel Stenberg (12 May 2009)
- typo

- comment typo and some indent fixes

- Partial fix based on the patch and discussions in #2788319

- clear the passed in struct when the entry has been removed to help prevent
  mistakes due to re-use

- use a better example file name for the known_hosts file

- split out the knownhost code from hostkey.c into its own separate source file
  now: knownhost.c

- this was never supposed to be added for real

- My knownhost work as of right now. It works at least partly. More tests and
  tweaks will come.

- get host, user, password and command from the command line

- Added ssh2_exec as a new example, showing how to run a command remotely with
  libssh2

- bug #2785173 pointed out that we really must call _libssh2_transport_read()
  in loops until it returns < 0 when we call it, as if we just call it once we
  may drain the socket for data and then leave unused in-memory data that we
  won't detect because the socket is back to idle...

-   Markus posted a bug report about a bad 0-return from libssh2_channel_read:
    http://libssh2.haxx.se/mail/libssh2-devel-archive-2009-04/0076.shtml
  
    And it was indeed a bad loop that terminated too early due to a receveived
    close packet.

- remove pointless sleeps

- edited

-   libssh2_poll() and libssh2_poll_channel_read() are now considered and
    documented deprecated and they will be removed at next soname bump. It also
    saves us from fixing some rather quirky bugs in libssh2_poll()...

Guenter Knauf (9 Apr 2009)
- some minor Makefile tweaks; mainly for crosscompiling.

Daniel Stenberg (6 Apr 2009)
- Jussi Mononen pointed out we used an unsigned variable to store negative
  values in, when a plain int is much better anyway since it matches the return
  type.

- and we're now on the 1.1.1 track

- release 1.1

- Sofian Brabez removed duplicate calls to libssh2_session_set_blocking()

- Uh, it is important that we don't set the local state 'local.close' to TRUE
  until _after_ we're done as otherwise we might not get called again properly
  to clean the entire thing since the close state is checked in
  libssh2_channel_free

- Removed the trace output that said "May block until packet of type..." since
  it simply wasn't true for non-blocking operations.

- made sure the SFTP code makes more use of internal non-blocking functions
  instead of the external API entries

- Fixed the memory leak in in libssh2_userauth_hostbased_fromfile_ex() that
  Jean-Louis Charton found. Additional minor indent and comment edits.

- indent changes and removed libssh2_ prefix from static function

Yang Tse (28 Mar 2009)
- include libssh2_priv.h instead of libssh2.h in order to get
  LIBSSH2_API properly defined on LIBSSH2_WIN32 build targets

Daniel Stenberg (27 Mar 2009)
- Additional non-blocking fixes.

- Me and my long fingers couldn't resist "merging" these statements in a previous
  commit but of course that broke functionality and this is a revert of that
  change.

- Dump to stderr simply because the other tracing functions in misc.c already
  use stderr and mixing output "channels" causes too much confusion for me!

- fixed sftp_shutdown() for the blockiness and fixed libssh2_channel_close()
  to work properly non-blocking

- Fixed the order of the check in the BLOCK_ADJUST() macro so that it also works
  for libssh2_session_free()

- kill warnings

- Fix the BLOCK_ADJUST_ERRNO() macro to behave properly in blocking mode.

Simon Josefsson (27 Mar 2009)
- Add AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR to avoid warnings with libtool v2.2.x.

Daniel Stenberg (27 Mar 2009)
- fix comments, moved to htonu64 function to sftp.c and made it static

- More cleaning up converting libssh2_ to _libssh2_ for internal functions and
  removing libssh2_ from static functions. Added mac.h.

- comp.c only as a single _libssh2_ function, no external one

- * Renamed the functions in src/transport.c to be _libssh2_transport_ prefixed
    and introduced a transport.h header.
  
  * Fixed the blocking mode to only change behavior not the actual underlying
    socket mode so we now always work with non-blocking sockets. This also
    introduces a new rule of thumb in libssh2 code: we don't call the
    external function calls internally. We use the internal (non-blocking)
    ones!
  
  * libssh2_channel_receive_window_adjust2 was added and
    libssh2_channel_receive_window_adjust is now deprecated
  
  * Introduced "local" header files with prototypes etc for different parts
    instead of cramming everything into libssh2_priv.h. channel.h is the
    first.

- avoid some busy-looping

- one function to remove, one proto to correct

- Updated comments and removed "libssh2_" prefixes from static functions

- added basic docs

- quite possibly one of the most pointless functions in the libssh2 API...a

- ENOTCONN obviously doesn't exist in win32 so don't try to map that

- [no comment]

- EEK revert the part of the previous commit that was just my non-functional
  attempts to make things work with blocking sockets.

- I cut out the poll_socket argument from the protos for_libssh2_packet_askv()
  and _libssh2_packet_ask() since they are internal and nothing in the code base
  uses that functionality == simplicity with no drawbacks!

- pass in unsigned ints for u32 values and not longs

- - (Mar 19 2009) Daniel Stenberg: based on a patch by "E L" we now use errno
    properly after recv() and send() calls (that internally are now known as
    _libssh2_recv() and _libssh2_send()) so that the API and more works fine on
    windows too!

- I'm upgrading myself!

Simon Josefsson (17 Mar 2009)
- Add StrictModes=no to work around cygwin problem.
  Reported by Yang Tse <yangsita@gmail.com>.

- Add UsePrivilegeSeparation=no for cygwin.
  Reported by Yang Tse <yangsita@gmail.com>

Daniel Stenberg (17 Mar 2009)
- re-indented for clarity

- re-indented _libssh2_channel_packet_data_len() somewhat to make the huge
  condition somewhat easier on the eye

- A cleanup effort: libssh2_ prefixes only on external APIs. Use _libssh2_ prefix
  for library-wide internal functions. Don't use any of those on static functions.
  I also did some comments and whitespace changes.

- bump packet default size to 32768

- Refer to the exact symbol name, which also is the exact file name of the man
  page file.

Simon Josefsson (17 Mar 2009)
- Use libtool -export-symbols-regex to reduce numer of exported symbols.

Daniel Stenberg (16 Mar 2009)
- cleanup round

- Added (templates for) the 13 missing man pages

- two more renaming of man pages to the actual function name

- rename the man page to use the same name as the actual function

- mention the basic changes in my previous few commits

- Patch from bug report #1960894 by "Heiner" applied, and edited by me. It makes
  SCP recv and send deal with file names containing spaces (and other
  shell-special letters) by quoting them before they are passed to the remote
  server.

- fixed some wrong comments and did a minor code edit and some further
  whitespace changes

- added three more public functions I found lacking man pages

- fix a compiler warning

- simplified how the "scp" command line is created in the libssh2_scp_recv()
  function

- Simplified libssh2_channel_read_ex() and made it send window adjustments less
  frequent, use a few less struct fields in the channel struct and improved
  reading from the network with libssh2_packet_read(). I also modified the
  windowing algorithm and now use a much larger window. This greatly enhances
  SSH/SCP performance. I also increased the size of the buffer the transport
  layer uses from 4k to 16K.

- oops, use %06d for the microseconds!

- re-indented and other whitespace edits

- improved trace logs with time stamps

- fixed to work quite similar to the sftp_nonblock example so that it waits
  for the socket correctly and measures the transfer speed fine

- Cleanups, that do seem to have boosted SFTP download performance up to 300% in
  some tests:
  
    * cut off "_ex" from several internal function names
  
    * corrected some log outputs
  
    * simplified libssh2_channel_read_ex() and made it much faster in the process
  
    * cut out {{{ and }}} comments that were incorrect anyway
  
    * fixed sftp_packet_ask() to return the correct packet by using memcmp() and
      not strncmp()
  
    * fixed mkdir()'s wait for packet to use the correct request_id - it
      semi-worked previously because strncmp() in sftp_packet_ask() made it
      match far too easily.
  
    * took away the polling functionality from sftp_packet_ask() since it wasn't
      used

- improved non-blocking behavior for some of the initing stuff before the actual
  data transfer begins

- wait for socket action accordingly, and do some measurements on the transfer
  to make this better to use for speed tests

- - (Mar 7 2009) Olivier Hervieu pointed out a flaw in the
    libssh2_channel_x11_req_ex() function that made it produce a crappy random
    chunk of data. Peter Stuge improved the fix to not do out-of-boundary
    writes. I (Daniel Stenberg) replaced the snprintf() with a plain sprintf()
    since the size argument wasn't adding anything anyway.

Guenter Knauf (6 Mar 2009)
- some minor Makefile tweaks.

Daniel Stenberg (23 Feb 2009)
- - Added libssh2_version()

- - (Feb 20 2009) libssh2_channel_direct_tcpip_ex() bug #1902169 fixed, which
    caused it to fail when called a second time.

Mikhail Gusarov (17 Feb 2009)
- Fixed dash-as-minus warning in libssh2_base64_decode.3 manpage

- Fixed syntax error in libssh2_banner_set.3 manpage

Simon Josefsson (16 Feb 2009)
- Bump ABI revision from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 due to code changes.

- Fix typo.

- Add date for v1.0 release.

Daniel Stenberg (12 Feb 2009)
- - (Feb 12 2009) Romain Bondue extended Markus Moeller fix from Feb 8, based on
    a previous (uncommitted) patch by Erik Brossler. It improves
    libssh2_channel_write_ex in blocking situations when the socket is set non-
    blocking.

- Markus Moeller fixed a flaw in libssh2_channel_write_ex() that would occur
  on EAGAIN situations.

- I want to remove all those macros from the official API at next soname bump

- fixed compiler warnings, and stripped off "libssh2_" from static functions
  as that makes shorter function names and then making the code look fine within
  80 columns is easier!

- made the three public headers use (mostly) lines shorter than 80 columns as
  HACKING says - it makes them much more readable to my old tired eyes...

- we're actually working on the 1.0.1 version now (or should it be 1.1?)

- Added 'TODO' file (again) with some fresh things I could think of right now

- Added libssh2_trace man page

- libssh2_base64_decode is deprecated and subject for removal in a future
  version (like on the next soname bump)

- wrote up a first libssh2_base64_decode man page, added a few missing man
  pages to the tarball

- based on Heiner Steven's report, fix the name and description of these man
  pages!

- briefly mention my recent sftp-related fixes

- mention web site and mailing list, as I think they're not mentioned anywhere
  else in the package!

- removed obviously superfluous comments

- use a single >>32 instead of "(value / 65536) / 65536", just make sure that
  the shift is done on a 64bit type

- remove unused #ifndef, and two whitespace changes

- style/indent changes only to enforce < 80 column lines more strict

- libssh2_sftp_seek64() it is now for the 64bit seek function too as the seek2
  name has never been used in a release and it makes the naming consistent

- 0.19 is now 1.0

- Based on Alexander Lamaison's patch, there's now a new
  function called libssh2_sftp_tell64() that returns the 64 bit file offset,
  as the existing libssh2_sftp_tell() only returns a size_t.

- first conversion of a malloc => buffer in the sftp handle struct

- helper script for emacs users to get the code style done libssh2-style
  automatically

- - Markus Moeller fixed the issue also reported by Alexander Lamaison which
    caused SFTP reads with large buffers to fail.

Simon Josefsson (17 Dec 2008)
- Sshd is slow to start on some systems.

Daniel Stenberg (17 Dec 2008)
- Avoid one malloc by putting the entire handle buffer in the handle struct
  at once, use a define for the maximum size length of the handle instead of
  '256' in the code.

- removed some more libssh2_ prefixes from private functions
  
  Made the libssh2_sftp_open_ex() deal with servers that first responds with
  STATUS OK and then sends the actual HANDLE. It seems openssh does this at
  times and it screwed things up. To me it seems like a spec violation...

- removed unused code, intended the code somewhat

- Nothing used libssh2_sftp_packet_read's flush argument anymore so I removed
  it and simplified the code somewhat thanks to that. I then renamed the function
  to sftp_packet_read() only since it is private in this file anyway.

- renamed libssh2_sftp_packet_requirev to plain sftp_packet_requirev since it
  is private in this file only and a shorter name is nicer
  
  Removed a "flush" of the data in sftp_packet_requirev() that now seems to have
  made SFTP operations a lot more reliable. It didn't make much sense to have it
  there but if someone can present a reason for one I figure we should carefully
  investigate one and only do it conditionally where/when needed.

- Clarify that this is only fine to use after an actual SFTP protocol error
  return code.

Simon Josefsson (27 Nov 2008)
- Support EXEEXT in self-test.

- Cygwin needs -lcrypto for -lssl.
  Reported by "Yang Tse" <yangsita@gmail.com>.

Daniel Stenberg (27 Nov 2008)
- oops, add missing file

Yang Tse (26 Nov 2008)
- fix again cygwin build failure unreleased regression

Dan Fandrich (25 Nov 2008)
- Fixed a potential use of an uninitialized variable, the result of which lead
  to an unneeded but harmless realloc.
  Reduced the scope of some automatic variables.

- Fixed some typos in log messages

Daniel Stenberg (24 Nov 2008)
- - Vlad Grachov brought the new function called
    libssh2_session_block_directions() which returns a bitmask for what
    directions the connection blocks. It is to be used applications that use
    non-blocking sockets and when a libssh2 function returns
    LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN this function can be used to figure out in which
    direction the socket would block and thus it can wait for the socket to
    again be ready for communication in that direction before it calls libssh2
    again.

Simon Josefsson (21 Nov 2008)
- Add a more realistic self-test of libssh2.

- Ignore coverage/.

- Add rules to generate a code coverage report.

- Use AM_CPPFLAGS instead of deprecated INCLUDES.

- Add self-test of base64 decode.

- Add gcov files.

Dan Fandrich (21 Nov 2008)
- Use only C89-style comments

- Check LIBSSH2_HMAC_RIPEMD consistently

Simon Josefsson (20 Nov 2008)
- Fix compiler warnings.

- Move pem.c to libgcrypt section, it is not needed for OpenSSL.

- Drop pkg-config test, not needed now.

- Rewrite OpenSSL+libz detection logic.

- Add more.

Daniel Stenberg (11 Nov 2008)
- fix the include path to also point out the build dir's src/ dir for the cases
  where we build the lot outside of the source dir

- avoid duplicate function declarations on windows

- WINSOCK_VERSION is no longer used (Richard W.M. Jones fixed)

- Richard W.M. Jones' 5 patches that enables libssh2 to get cross-compiled with
  mingw

Paul Thomas (9 Nov 2008)
- Fixes a problem that the last code change apparently didn't fix. Verified
  that this works correctly with another user.

- Fixed an issue with a patch that I submitted where the channel_read_ex()
  could get stuck in a busy read loop.

- fix cygwin build failure unreleased regression

Paul Thomas (3 Oct 2008)
- Reformatted the code, updated line endings to match original file,
  fixed the build problem, removed tabs and replaced with spaces
   and removed C89 unfriendly comments.

- mention libssh2_channel_request_pty_size_ex()

- two new committers!

Paul Thomas (2 Oct 2008)
- This fix addresses bug# 2141548. Channel reads would fail despite
  libssh2_poll() detecting that there was data ready to be read on
  the socket. This is seen when small amounts of data are ready to
  be read, typically 1-4 chars worth.

- Committed changes to add in support for pty resizing. Credit for this
  patch goes to Vincent Jaulin.

- Fixed an issue with the libssh2_poll_channel_read function not
  reading both normal and extended data when a non-zero value
  is passed in as the 2nd parameter. This now matches the functionallity
  described in the documentation.

- Carlo Bramini fixed the build for msys+mingw. Bug #1943976.

- Carlo Bramini's fixes for the nonblocking examples for msys/mingw

- Neil Gierman provided improved Visual Studio 2008 code in bug #1946268

- - Bug #1862727 fixed libssh2_poll() to work on windows (by defining HAVE_SELECT).

- - Based on bug #1815692, we introduce libssh2_sftp_seek2() that allows seeking
    beyond the 2GB margin even on 32bit machines.

- - Based on a patch in bug #1878059 by Steven Ayre libssh2 now parses >2GB file
    sizes when downloading SCP files.
