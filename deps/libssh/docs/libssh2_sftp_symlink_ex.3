.SH NAME
libssh2_sftp_symlink_ex - read or set a symbolic link
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <libssh2.h>
#include <libssh2_sftp.h>

int 
libssh2_sftp_symlink_ex(LIBSSH2_SFTP *sftp, const char *path,
                        unsigned int path_len, char *target,
                        unsigned int target_len, int link_type);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Create a symlink or read out symlink information from the remote side.

\fIsftp\fP - SFTP instance as returned by 
.BR libssh2_sftp_init(3)

\fIpath\fP - Remote filesystem object to create a symlink from or resolve.

\fIpath_len\fP - Length of the name of the remote filesystem object to 
create a symlink from or resolve.

\fItarget\fP - a pointer to a buffer. The buffer has different uses depending
what the \fIlink_type\fP argument is set to.
.br
\fBLIBSSH2_SFTP_SYMLINK\fP: Remote filesystem object to link to.
.br
\fBLIBSSH2_SFTP_READLINK\fP: Pre-allocated buffer to resolve symlink target
into.
.br
\fBLIBSSH2_SFTP_REALPATH\fP: Pre-allocated buffer to resolve realpath target
into.

\fItarget_len\fP - Length of the name of the remote filesystem target object.

\fIlink_type\fP - One of the three previously mentioned constants which 
determines the resulting behavior of this function.

These are convenience macros:

.BR libssh2_sftp_symlink(3)
: Create a symbolic link between two filesystem objects.
.br
.BR libssh2_sftp_readlink(3)
: Resolve a symbolic link filesystem object to its next target.
.br
.BR libssh2_sftp_realpath(3)
: Resolve a complex, relative, or symlinked filepath to its effective target.
.SH RETURN VALUE
When using LIBSSH2_SFTP_SYMLINK, this funtion returns 0 on success or negative
on failure.

When using LIBSSH2_SFTP_READLINK or LIBSSH2_SFTP_REALPATH, it returns the
number of bytes it copied to the target buffer (not including the terminating
zero) or negative on failure.

It returns LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN when it would otherwise block. While
LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN is a negative number, it isn't really a failure per se.

From 1.2.8, LIBSSH2_ERROR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL is returned if the given 'target'
buffer is too small to fit the requested object name.
.SH BUG
Passing in a too small buffer when receiving data only results in libssh2
1.2.7 or earlier to not copy the entire data amount, and it is not possible
for the application to tell when it happens!
.SH ERRORS
\fILIBSSH2_ERROR_ALLOC\fP -  An internal memory allocation call failed.

\fILIBSSH2_ERROR_SOCKET_SEND\fP - Unable to send data on socket.

\fILIBSSH2_ERROR_SOCKET_TIMEOUT\fP - 

\fILIBSSH2_ERROR_SFTP_PROTOCOL\fP - An invalid SFTP protocol response was 
received on the socket, or an SFTP operation caused an errorcode to 
be returned by the server.
