.SH NAME
libssh2_sftp_fstat_ex - get or set attributes on an SFTP file handle
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <libssh2.h>
#include <libssh2_sftp.h>

int 
libssh2_sftp_fstat_ex(LIBSSH2_SFTP_HANDLE *handle,
                      LIBSSH2_SFTP_ATTRIBUTES *attrs, int setstat)

#define libbssh2_sftp_fstat(handle, attrs) \\
    libssh2_sftp_fstat_ex((handle), (attrs), 0)
#define libssh2_sftp_fsetstat(handle, attrs) \\
    libssh2_sftp_fstat_ex((handle), (attrs), 1)
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIhandle\fP - SFTP File Handle as returned by 
.BR libssh2_sftp_open_ex(3)

\fIattrs\fP - Pointer to an LIBSSH2_SFTP_ATTRIBUTES structure to set file
metadata from or into depending on the value of setstat.

\fIsetstat\fP - When non-zero, the file's metadata will be updated 
with the data found in attrs according to the values of attrs->flags 
and other relevant member attributes.

Get or Set statbuf type data for a given LIBSSH2_SFTP_HANDLE instance.
.SH DATA TYPES
LIBSSH2_SFTP_ATTRIBUTES is a typedefed struct that is defined as below

.nf
struct _LIBSSH2_SFTP_ATTRIBUTES {

    /* If flags & ATTR_* bit is set, then the value in this
     * struct will be meaningful Otherwise it should be ignored
     */
    unsigned long flags;

    /* size of file, in bytes */
    libssh2_uint64_t filesize;

    /* numerical representation of the user and group owner of
     * the file
     */
    unsigned long uid, gid;

    /* bitmask of permissions */
    unsigned long permissions;

    /* access time and modified time of file */
    unsigned long atime, mtime;
};
.fi

You will find a full set of defines and macros to identify flags and
permissions on the \fBlibssh2_sftp.h\fP header file, but some of the
most common ones are:

To check for specific user permissions, the set of defines are in the
pattern LIBSSH2_SFTP_S_I<action><who> where <action> is R, W or X for
read, write and excutable and <who> is USR, GRP and OTH for user,
group and other. So, you check for a user readable file, use the bit
\fILIBSSH2_SFTP_S_IRUSR\fP while you want to see if it is executable
for other, you use \fILIBSSH2_SFTP_S_IXOTH\fP and so on.

To check for specific file types, you would previously (before libssh2
1.2.5) use the standard posix S_IS***() macros, but since 1.2.5
libssh2 offers its own set of macros for this functionality:
.IP LIBSSH2_SFTP_S_ISLNK
Test for a symbolic link
.IP LIBSSH2_SFTP_S_ISREG
Test for a regular file
.IP LIBSSH2_SFTP_S_ISDIR
Test for a directory
.IP LIBSSH2_SFTP_S_ISCHR
Test for a character special file
.IP LIBSSH2_SFTP_S_ISBLK
Test for a block special file
.IP LIBSSH2_SFTP_S_ISFIFO
Test for a pipe or FIFO special file
.IP LIBSSH2_SFTP_S_ISSOCK
Test for a socket
.SH RETURN VALUE
Return 0 on success or negative on failure.  It returns
LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN when it would otherwise block. While
LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN is a negative number, it isn't really a failure per se.
.SH ERRORS
\fILIBSSH2_ERROR_ALLOC\fP -  An internal memory allocation call failed.

\fILIBSSH2_ERROR_SOCKET_SEND\fP - Unable to send data on socket.

\fILIBSSH2_ERROR_SOCKET_TIMEOUT\fP - 

\fILIBSSH2_ERROR_SFTP_PROTOCOL\fP - An invalid SFTP protocol response was 
received on the socket, or an SFTP operation caused an errorcode to 
be returned by the server.
.SH AVAILABILITY
This function has been around since forever, but most of the
LIBSSH2_SFTP_S_* defines were introduced in libssh2 0.14 and the
LIBSSH2_SFTP_S_IS***() macros were introduced in libssh2 1.2.5.
